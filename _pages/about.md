Welcome! I'm a Doctoral Candidate at the [Research Training Group DYNAMICS](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), which is jointly organised by the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and the [Humboldt-University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/). At the Hertie School, I'm affiliated with the Research Project on "Election Forecasts for the German Federal Election 2025" as a Research Associate.

My research focusses on party behaviour and parliamentary politics in established democracies, engaging with work on public opinion. In my dissertation project, which is supervised by [Prof. Dr. Simon Munzert](https://simonmunzert.com/) and [Prof. Dr. Heike Klüver](https://www.heike-kluever.com/), I study the behavioural and attitudinal consequences of election polls among political elites, voters, and the media. Methodologically, I specialise in econometric and experimental approaches within the social sciences, as well as in techniques for quantitative text analysis.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained a BA and MA in Social Science from [Humboldt-University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/) and visited [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) for studies abroad.
